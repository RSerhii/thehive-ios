# Dissenter for iOS

Welcome to the free speech internet. Dissenter for iOS is a fork of [Brave for iOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-ios), so it's fast and it blocks ads and 3rd-party trackers.


# Build Instructions

We may create our own version of this, but for now you can see the Brave iOS build documentation at https://github.com/brave/brave-ios.


# Downloads

You can visit https://dissenter.com to find Dissenter for your operating system.
